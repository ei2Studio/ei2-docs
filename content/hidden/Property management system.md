# Definition:
A Property Management System (PMS) in a hotel is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and centralize various operational tasks essential for efficient hotel management. Its **key functions** encompass reservation management, check-in/check-out processes, billing and invoicing, and room assignment, providing a centralized platform for overseeing daily operations. The **reservation module** enables hotels to manage room bookings, track availability, and input guest details efficiently. During check-in and check-out, the PMS automates the process, ensuring a swift and error-free experience for guests. Additionally, the system facilitates **billing and invoicing**, automating financial transactions, and ensuring accurate billing for services. The PMS is pivotal in maintaining a real-time inventory of room availability, preventing overbooking, and optimizing room allocation. Integration with other systems, such as point-of-sale and housekeeping, enhances the system's versatility. Ultimately, a PMS enhances operational efficiency, minimizes errors, and provides hoteliers with valuable insights through its reporting and analytics features, contributing significantly to an improved overall guest experience.
